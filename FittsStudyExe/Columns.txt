NOTES:
Comma-separated results file for FittsStudy. Each file row is a spreadsheet row 
representing one trial. Each row has all the information needed to describe that 
trial.

ALSO SEE: Columns.xlsx (Excel file with the same information, color-coded.)

TERMINOLOGY:
- A "movement" is the mouse movement associated with a trial. Class: MovementData.
- A "trial" is one click attempting to hit a target. Class: TrialData.
- A "condition" is one (A x W) or (A x W x MT%) set of trials. Class: ConditionData.
- A "block" is one set of conditions. Having multiple blocks means all conditions are run in the same order multiple times.
- A "session" is a collection of conditions for one subject. Class: SessionData.
- A "study" is a collection of sessions over multiple subjects. Program: FittsStudy.exe.

OUTLIERS:
Two types of outliers are defined. Spatial outliers are determined at the trial level by comparing 
Ae to A and |dx| to W. Temporal outliers in metronome studies are time-based outliers that can be 
determined at the trial level by comparing MTe to MT. For calculations in which spatial outliers are 
excluded, an "(sx)" suffix is added to the column name. For calculations in which temporal outliers are 
excluded, a "(tx)" suffix is added.

1D vs. 2D:
For a circular-target study, the approach to calculating SDx and, therefore, We = 4.133 * SDx, can
be done using a univariate (1d) concept of deviation or a bivariate (2d) one. (For univariate
deviation, think of a horizontal trial, and deviation would be calculated only along the x-axis, 
ignoring orthogonal (y-axis) deviation.) For relevant measures, calculations done with a univariate model
are marked with the suffix "(1d)", and for a bivariate model, "(2d)". For one-dimensional ribbon trials,
the two values should be identical since movement orthogonal to the task axis is ignored.

LEGEND BELOW:
For movement-level data, a slash (/) is used. For trial-level data, a colon (:) is used. 
For condition-level data, a vertical bar (|) is used. For session-level data, an exclamation 
point (!) is used. (Note that because each movement is associated with one and only one trial,
movement statistics are also trial-level statistics.)
